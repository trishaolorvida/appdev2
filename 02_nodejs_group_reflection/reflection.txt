1. As one of the UI/UX designers of the group, I’m assigned to create the design of our system.
I can say that I contributed my fair share, mostly doing most of the prototypes to have a working figma 
(which was still a static because we’re out of time). One of the challenges I encountered is that 
the machine I’m using lags after using it for a certain amount of time, but all is well and I still 
manage to finish my deliverables in time. I extend my working hours to make up with the days I’m 
not able to work. I learned that communication is really important especially if there are changes 
so it can be changed as soon 

2. The team may not be perfect but everything was solved as soon as it was addressed. It’s normal for 
the group to have problems but what is important is to address it the sooner the better so the Project 
Managers can handle it and fix it. I can say that everything went well even though there are obstacles, 
like misunderstandings and such, the team members have cooperated well and did their parts well. Communication 
could be improved, it’s also for the betterment of the group. The Project managers delegated the tasks very 
well, everyone finished their deliverables on time and that is great.

3. As a UI/UX Designer, I want to improve my skills further and increase my knowledge in designing. I want 
to learn more about techniques and how to make things much easier. I also want to enhance my skills in frontend 
development because I believe that the two are connected.
